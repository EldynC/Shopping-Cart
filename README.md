# Shopping Cart!
I created this app because often, when I went grocery shopping, I wanted to know the total price of my shopping cart including tax so I knew how much I was spending. Unfortunately, many of the apps in the App Store had pay walls, blocking certain features like tax rate modification and limitation to only one item at a time. In my head, what was the point of paying for an app that does that when I could just make my own? So here we are!
